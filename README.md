# React News App
This is a React-based news application that fetches data from the NewsAPI.org API and displays news articles in the form of cards. Each card contains a small photo, a brief description, a link to the full article, and the date and time the article was published.

The application uses the React-DOM-Router to allow users to switch between different news categories, such as business, sports, technology, and entertainment. The application also includes an infinite scroll bar React component that allows users to keep scrolling through articles without having to manually load new pages.
